    <p>Whether you're a new user wanting to get a feel for how this system works or you're more experienced but wanting to improve your knowledge, we hope that this page will be helpful to you. The information here is organized according to the various things you might want to do using the system - for example, clocking in and out. Click one of the large buttons below to start reading about that particular feature. If after reading you still have unanswered questions, please see an administrator for clarification.</p>

    <p> ~ Yours - Nadiia, Chris, and David (Creators of the Volunteer Management System)</p>

    <h3>All Users</h3>

    <!-- Clocking in/out -->
    <button class="accordion">Tracking Your Volunteer Hours - Clocking In/Out</button>
    <div class="accordion-panel">
        <p>If you've just walked into the clinic and you're ready to clock in for the day, just enter your email address in the Sign In/Out box and click or tap Submit. <strong>Note: You don't have to be logged in to clock in/out.</strong></p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Home_ClockIn.png" />

        <p>The Recent Activity tracker will now show your name and the time you clocked in.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Home_ClockInRecentActivity.png" />

        <p>When you want to clock out, you'll go through the same process again: Enter your email, select Submit. Your activity will again show up in the tracker. Now the "Out" column will have your clock-out time.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Home_ClockOutRecentActivity.png" />

        <p><strong>Note: Don't worry if you forgot to clock in/out. You can ask an administrator to enter your hours.</strong></p>

        <p>Clocking in and out is pretty much the only thing you can do without first logging in. If you haven't logged in already, you can do so by selecting "Log In" at the top right of your screen. See the "Logging In To Your Profile" section, below, for more details.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Login -->
    <button class="accordion">Logging In To Your Profile</button>
    <div class="accordion-panel">

        <p>To get to the Login page, click or tap "Log In" at the top right of your screen.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_LogIn_ClickLogInFromHomePage.png" />

        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_LogIn_Overview.png" />

        <p>Enter your email address and password. (Note: If you're not yet a registered user, please speak to an administrator so that he/she can help you set up a profile.)</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_LogIn_EnterCreds.png" />

        <p>If you want your web browser to remember your password for you, then check "Remember me". Then the next time that you come back to the log in screen, your browser will enter your password for you automatically. However, please note that this is <strong>NOT</strong> recommended if you're using a shared computer at the clinic, because then anyone who uses the computer after you can also use your saved password to log in as you.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_LogIn_CheckRememberMe.png" />

        <p>Now select "Log In".</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_LogIn_ClickLogInButton.png" />

        <p>If something was entered incorrectly, you'll see a red "Invalid login attempt" message.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_LogIn_InvalidLogInAttempt.png" />

        <p>Otherwise, you are now logged in and can navigate to your volunteer profile page by clicking "Hello [your name here]!" at the top right of the screen.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_LogIn_NowLoggedIn.png" />

        <p>When you're done using your profile, it's best that you log out, and <strong>especially</strong> if you're using a shared computer at the clinic. You probably don't want the next person using that computer to be able to use your profile while it's still logged in.</p>

        <p>To log out, just select "Log Out" at the top right of your screen. The screen changes to show "Log In" at the top right, indicating that you are now logged out.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_LogIn_ClickLogOut.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_LogIn_LogOutResult.png" />

    </div>

    <!-- Profile page -->
    <button class="accordion">Viewing and Editing your Profile Information</button>
    <div class="accordion-panel">
        <p>From the home page, if you select "Hello [your name here]!" (assuming that you're logged in), you'll be taken to your profile.</p>

        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_Overview.png" />

        <p>Here you can see your personal information. This information is visible to all administrators, but not by other volunteers. Administrators use this information to keep track of things like when you're available to volunteer, what your specialties are, and whether you're still an active volunteer. </p>

        <p>If you want to change something in your basic personal details, select Edit.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_ClickEdit.png" />

        <p>Now you can edit those fields. Note that if you enter something in the wrong format (for example, a phone number without an area code, an email address without an "at" symbol), the page will display a red error message beneath each of the items that need to be fixed.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_EditErrors.png" />

        <p>There's more that we can change here. Notice first the "Language" section. This represents the languages that you can speak. You can pick a new language from the dropdown list and select "Add More" to add it to the list. </p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_AddLanguage1.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_AddLanguage2.png" />

        <p>You can also edit your emergency contact list and the info concerning your employer, license(s), and contract(s). All four of these have "Update" buttons, and all four work pretty much the same way, so instead of covering them all, we'll just go over updating employer info as an exmaple.</p>

        <p>After you click "Update", you'll see a page in which you can add an employer to your list or edit an existing one. John, our example, currently has no employer listed, so we'll add one for him by first selecting "Add Employment". This takes us to the "Add New Employment" page.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_Employment_ClickAddEmployment.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_Employment_AddNewEmployment_Overview.png" />

        <p>Choose an employer from the dropdown list, fill in a title and your start and end dates (format: MM/DD/YYYY), and you're good to go. But wait, what if your employer isn't in the list? No problem. Click "Add New Employer". From the page that you'll be taken to, you can add a new employer to the list, then come back and select it.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_Employment_AddNewEmployment_ClickAddNewEmployer.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_Employment_AddNewEmployment_AddNewEmployer_Overview.png" />

        <p>When you're done, click or tap Save Changes.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_EditClickSaveChanges.png" />

        <p>Notice the Timesheet section on the bottom left of the page. This will show the most recent times that you clocked in or out. You can also clock in or out right now by using the green button. </p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_Timesheet.png" />

        <p>Finally, there is the "Available for Volunteering" section. This shows the days of the week and times that you have indicated are when you can volunteer at the clinic. To change the times, select "Update Availability". The process will work in a similar way to the employer info process that we discussed above.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_Availability.png" />

    </div>

    <!-- Changing your password -->
    <button class="accordion">Changing Your Password, and What To Do If You Forget It</button>
    <div class="accordion-panel">
        <p>First of all, if you've forgotten your password, ask an administrator to reset it for you. This will change it to "Password1!", case-sensitive, which you can then use to log in. <strong>IT IS VERY IMPORTANT</strong> that you follow the instructions below to change your password <strong>immediately</strong> after doing this. If you do not, your account will be highly susceptible to unauthorized use by a hacker or another user, since we've just written on this page for all the world to see what your password gets changed to when it's reset. For the safety and privacy of your personal information, and to prevent hack attacks on the system, please change your password immediately. Now, we'll get off the soapbox.</p>
        <p>To change your password, navigate to your profile page by clicking on "Hello, [your name here]!" at the top right of your screen. Then, inside your profile page, select Manage Account.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_ManageAccount_ClickManageAccount.png" />

        <p>From the Manage Account page, choose "Change Password".</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_ChangePassword_ClickChangePassword.png" />

        <p>On the Change Password Form page, enter your current password and then your desired password. You'll have to enter the new one twice, so that if you make a typo, you'll catch it now, which is a lot better than not being able to log in later!</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_ChangePassword_ChangeForm_ClickChange.png" />

        <p>Lastly, remember that your password must have at least one character that is not a letter. This can be a digit or symbol. The reason for this is that it makes passwords harder to break for a hacker.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_ChangePassword_ChangeForm_Error.png" />
    </div>

    <h3>Administrators</h3>

    <!-- Dashboard -->
    <button class="accordion">Using the Dashboard</button>
    <div class="accordion-panel">
        <p>On the dashboard page you'll see a table of volunteers, with information about them including last name, first name, specialty (e.g. Nurse, Physican), email address, phone number, the date he/she started volunteering, and a checkbox indicating whether he/she is still an active volunteer.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Dashboard_Overview.png" />

        <p>You can filter the volunteers shown in the table in several different ways to see only the ones that you need to see right now. For example, if you select the "Last Name" column header...</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Dashboard_ClickLastNameHeader.png" />

        <p>You'll see that the list is now filtered in order of last name descending. If you were to click or tap the header again, it would reorder by last name ascending.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Dashboard_OrderedByLastName.png" />

        <p>You can also order in the same way by start date.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Dashboard_ClickStartDate1stTime.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Dashboard_OrderedByStartDate1stTime.png" />

        <p>If you click the start date header again, it'll display in reverse order.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Dashboard_OrderedByStartDate2ndTime.png" />

        <p>If you want to see only active volunteers, click or tap the "Active" header.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Dashboard_ClickActiveHeader1stTime.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Dashboard_ShowingOnlyActive.png" />

        <p>Selecting it again will show only inactive volunteers.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Dashboard_ShowingOnlyInactive.png" />

        <p>You can also search directly for someone by their name. Type the name into the text box above the table and click or tap Search.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Dashboard_SearchByName.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Dashboard_NameSearchResult.png" />

        <p>And, last but not least, you can filter by the person's specialty, that is, his/her role at the clinic (e.g. physician, RN, podiatrist). Choose a specialty and click or tap Filter.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Dashboard_ChooseSpecialty.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Dashboard_ChooseSpecialtyClickFilter.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Dashboard_ChooseSpecialtyResults.png" />

        <p>Next to each volunteer you'll see a Details button and an Edit button. The Details button takes you to the profile page of that volunteer, which has more in-depth info on that person, and the Edit button will take you to directly to a page where you can edit that person's info. See Viewing and Editing a Volunteer's Profile for more information. </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Viewing and editing a profile -->
    <button class="accordion">Viewing and Editing a Volunteer's Profile</button>
    <div class="accordion-panel">

        <p>From the Dashboard, if you click Details next to John Example, you'll be taken to his profile page.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_ViewEdit_ClickEditFromDashboard.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_ViewEdit_Overview.png" />

        <p>Now that we're on John Example's profile page, we can see his picture, his personal info, what languages he speaks, whom he works for, his most recent timesheet activity, and when he's available to volunteer. We can also change his password, but we'll discuss that in the "Resetting a User's Password" section below.</p>

        <p>John can of course change his own profile information using his volunteer account. But since you're an administrator, you also can change it. Notice the buttons scattered around this page that let you change various things.</p>

        <p>If you click or tap "Edit", you'll see that now you can change his basic personal information, like first name, last name, and address. This is the same page that you would end up at if you selected "Edit" in John's row on the Dashboard page.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_ViewEdit_EditPage.png" />

        <p>Notice that the "Specialty" field is a little different. If John's specialty (e.g. RN, physician, nutritionist) isn't in the dropdown list that you see there, you might want to add a new one. If you select "Add Specialty", you'll be taken to a page in which you can create a new specialty and save it. After saving a new specialty, you'll be taken back to this page.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_ViewEdit_AddSpecialtyClick.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_ViewEdit_AddSpecialtyPage.png" />

        <p>Notice that John here is not an active volunteer - the "Active" checkbox is unchecked. John hasn't been seen since he ran away to join the circus some time ago, but we're really hoping that he'll come back. It's up to you and the other administrators to decide how long goes by before a volunteer should be considered inactive.</p>

        <p>There's more that we can change here. Notice first the "Language" section. This represents the alternative (non-English) language(s) that the volunteer can speak. You can pick a new language from the dropdown list and select Update to add it to the list. </p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_AddLanguage1.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_AddLanguage2.png" />

        <p>You can also edit the volunteer's emergency contact list, and the info concerning his/her employer, license(s), and contract(s). All four of these have "Update" buttons, and all four work pretty much the same way, so instead of covering them all, we'll just go over updating employer info, since it is probably the most complex out of the four.</p>

        <p>After you click "Update", you'll see a screen where you can add an employer to the list or edit an existing one. John, our example, currently has no employer listed, so we'll add one for him by first selecting "Add Employment". This takes us to the "Add New Employment" page.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_Employment_ClickAddEmployment.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_Employment_AddNewEmployment_Overview.png" />

        <p>Choose an employer from the dropdown list, fill in a title and the start and end dates (format: MM/DD/YYYY), and you're good to go. But wait, what if the employer isn't in the list? No problem. Click "Add New Employer". From the page that you'll be taken to, you can add a new employer to the list, then come back and select it.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_Employment_AddNewEmployment_ClickAddNewEmployer.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_Employment_AddNewEmployment_AddNewEmployer_Overview.png" />

        <p>When you're done, click or tap Save Changes.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_EditClickSaveChanges.png" />

        <p>Notice the Timesheet section on the bottom left of the screen. This will show the most recent times that the volunteer clocked in or out. You can also clock the volunteer in or out right now by using the green button.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_Timesheet.png" />

        <p>Finally, there is the "Available for Volunteering" section. This shows the days of the week and times that the volunteer has indicated are when he/she can be volunteering at the clinic. To change the times, select "Update Availability". The process will work in a similar way to the employer screens that we discussed above.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_Availability.png" />

        <!--
        <p>Notice also that the "Specialty" field is a little different. If John's specialty (e.g. RN, physician, nutritionist) isn't in the dropdown list that you see there, you might want to add a new one. If you select "Add Specialty", you'll be taken to a page in which you can create a new specialty and save it. After saving a new specialty, you'll be taken back to this page.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_ViewEdit_AddSpecialtyClick.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_ViewEdit_AddSpecialtyPage.png" />
        <!-- Img: Taken back to Edit page

        <p>If you make any changes to this profile, click or tap Save once you're done. If anything was entered incorrectly (e.g. a date in the wrong format), you'll see a red error message appear below the items that need to be changed before the info can be saved. </p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_ViewEdit_EditSaveAttemptWithError.png" />

        <p>If you don't want to make any changes, just click or tap "Back to List", and you'll be returned to the main Dashboard screen.</p>

        <p>Next, notice that we can change John's emergency contact information. Click or tap "Update" next to "Emergency Contact" to get started.</p>

        <p>Now we're at a page showing John's emergency contacts - Notice that he currently has none listed. We can change that by selecting "Add New" at the top. </p>

        <p>On the next page, we can enter a first name, last name, and phone number for a contact. Click or tap "Add" to save this contact. As before, if any invalid information was entered, you'll see red error messages.</p>

        <p>We can also change John's employment info from his profile page. Click or tap "Details" and you'll see a screen just like the emergency contacts page. It works the same way - Click or tap "Add Employment", fill out the necessary fields, and save. </p>

        <p>Similarly, you can add times of availability for John. Click "Update Availability", and you'll be taken to a place in which you can add new times of availability, similarly to adding emergency contacts and employment info above.</p>

        <p>If you add an availability period, you'll see it in the table in John's profile.</p>

        <p>Lastly, notice next that we can add a language that John speaks. Choose a language from the dropdown list, and then click "Add".</p>

    <button class="accordion">Using the Administrator Menu</button>
    <div class="accordion-panel">

        <p>Let's talk about that blue menu that's on the left side of your screen when you're in the Dashboard.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Dashboard_SideMenuOverview.png" />

        <p>The menu is what gives you access to most of the controls you have at your disposal as an admin. Only administrators have access to this menu; other volunteers can't use it. It will follow you around as you do various things inside the Dashboard area.</p>

        <p>The "View" panel gives you several quick shortcuts to pages that you can acccess from within the Dashboard. Similarly, the "Update" panel gives shortcuts for editing several areas within the Dashboard. It also includes options to update home page messages and the worklog, which we'll discuss below along with everything in the "Create" panel.</p>

        <!--<p>You'll see that under "View" the first option is "Volunteers" - That will take you straight to this volunteer list screen that we're currently on. This option is available because you may want to jump back here from a page somewhere else.</p>

See the Creating a Volunteer Profile section for more information. The second option, "New Report", will take you to the Reports page where you can have the system analyze your volunteers and produce a report for you.</p>

        <p>Under "Update", notice "Home Page Messages". This takes you to a page where you can control the content currently shown in the "Message From Admin" and "Image From Admin" boxes on the Home page. See the Posting Information on the Home Page section for more info. </p> -->

        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_CreateAdmin_ClickCreateAdminOnMenu.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_CreateAdmin_Overview.png" />

        <p>On this page, all you need to do to make an existing volunteer into an admin is enter their email and select "Create".</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_CreateAdmin_EnterEmail.png" />

        <p>You'll be taken to a page showing the list of all admin accounts. From here, you can remove admin privileges from an account using the "Delete" button. Note that this will not erase the volunteer from the system; it just takes away the admin privileges.</p>

    <!-- Posting home page information-->
    <button class="accordion">Posting Information on the Home Page</button>
    <div class="accordion-panel">

        <p>As an administrator, you have the ability to display announcements and other info (including images) on the home page in a place where everybody will see it whenever they're clocking in. We've built a page into the system where you can control what's displayed. To get to that page, select "Update" from the side menu, then select "Home Page Messages". </p>


        <p>Notice now the two boxes in which you can change what's currently displayed. The first box changes the text area in the top left part of the home page. The second box controls what image is shown in the box beneath the first. </p>

        <p>To change the text area, enter your desired message and then click Submit. Your message will now be displayed on the Home page. </p>

        <p>To change the image, select "Browse...". A new window will appear prompting you to choose an image file from the PC or mobile device that you're currently using. Using this window, navigate to where the image is stored on your device and select it. Assuming that you have at least a moderately strong Internet connection right now, the image will upload to the site. Click Submit and your image will now be displayed on the home page.</p>

        <p>Please keep in mind when making changes to both text and images displayed on the home page that your changes can be undone by another administrator. You may want to check with the other administrators that you won't conflict with something that someone else is going to post soon.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Hours report -->
    <button class="accordion">Generating and Using Hours Reports</button>
    <div class="accordion-panel">

        <p>The hours report shows how many hours have been worked by volunteers meeting certain criteria which you specify. You'll also get the grand total of all hours worked during the time range that you specify.</p>

        <p>From the admin menu, open the "Create" panel, and select "New Hours Report".</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_HoursReport_ClickHoursReport.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_HoursReport_Overview.png" />

        <p>Here, you can apply several filters to your report. If you use no filters, you'll get everything - all specialties, all activity statuses, all dates. As an example, let's say that we're trying to get the hours of all support staff which are currently active, between April 12th and May 20th.</p>

        <p>First, choose "Support Staff" from the dropdown list of specialties.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_HoursReport_SelectSupportStaff.png" />

        <p>Then choose "True" from the Activity dropdown.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_HoursReport_SelectTrue.png" />

        <p>Now, open the calendar widget, and choose April 12th as the start date for your range.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_HoursReport_SelectStartingRange.png" />

        <p>Then choose May 20th as the end date, and click Apply.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_HoursReport_SelectEndOfRange.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_HoursReport_DateClickApply.png" />

        <p>Now you're all set. Click "Filter" and watch the magic happen. In this case, we get a result of just one volunteer.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_HoursReport_ClickFilter.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_HoursReport_FilterResult.png" />

        <p>You can also export these results to Excel using the green button. This will create and download a pre-formatted Excel sheet for you. At the download prompt, choose Open to view the sheet just once or Save to copy it to your computer.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Availability report -->
    <button class="accordion">Generating and Using Availability Reports</button>
    <div class="accordion-panel">

        <p>The availability report shows you when volunteers are available to work at the clinic.</p>

        <p>From the admin menu, open the "Create" panel, and select "New Availability Report".</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_AvailReport_ClickAvailReport.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_AvailReport_Overview.png" />

        <p>Here, you can apply several filters to narrow your results.If you click "Filter" now, you won't get any results. You first need to specify at least a day of the week. For an example, let's say that we want to see the availability of physicians, who are currently active, on Mondays and Wednesdays.</p>

        <p>First, choose Physicians from the dropdown list.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_AvailReport_SelectPhysician.png" />

        <p>Now choose "True" from the Activity dropdown.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_AvailReport_SelectTrue.png" />

        <p>Choose Monday and Wednesday.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_AvailReport_SelectMonday.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_AvailReport_SelectWednesday.png" />

        <p>And lastly, click or tap Filter. You'll see that in this case we get a result of just one physician who is available Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Notice that Monday and Wednesday are in bold since they're the days you chose to filter by.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_AvailReport_ClickFilter.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_AvailReport_FilterResult.png" />

        <p>You can also export these results to Excel using the green button. This will create and download a pre-formatted Excel sheet for you. At the download prompt, choose Open to view the sheet just once or Save to copy it to your computer.</p>

    <!-- Creating a backup -->
    <button class="accordion">Creating a Backup</button>
    <div class="accordion-panel">
        <p>Backups allow you to save copies of the information storied in the VMS database for safekeeping or future reference. We recommend that you backup the database at least once every month. This will allow you to recover in case the database is corrupted, destroyed, or infected with a virus. The last of these three is a scenario that is particularly concerning and has been happening more frequently in recent years. Ransomware is a kind of virus that encrypts your data (putting it in an unusable form) and forces you to pay a ransom to the hackers in order to get it back. It usually gets into a computer when an unsuspecting person opens an infected email attachment. If The Way gets hit with ransomware, though, all that you need to do is restore the database from one of your backups, and you'll be good to go, without being forced to pay the ransom.</p>

        <p>Anyway, to get to the backup page, open the "Create" panel in the admin menu, and select "New Backup Data".</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Backup_ClickBackup.png" />
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Backup_Overview.png" />

        <p>You have two ways to backup your data from here. You can create a backup of the entire database as a ".bak" file, or save individual parts (tables) of the database as Excel spreadsheets.</p>

        <p>If you select "Backup Database to .Bak File", the system will create the file and then prompt you to download it. Choose "Save File" or "Save Target As" at the prompt to copy the file to your computer.</p>
        <!-- File download prompt -->

        <p>You can also keep track of your previous backups. Select "Click here to manage previous backups", and you'll be taken to the Manage Backups page.</p>
        
        <p>Here you can see a listing of your most recent backups and when they were done.</p> 
        <!-- Manage Backups page -->

        <p>If you want to download an individual table file, choose the table you need, and when the download prompt opens, chooose "Save File" or "Save Target As" to copy it to your computer, or choose "Open with..." if you just want to view the spreadsheet once.</p>
        <img class="img-responsive-help" src="~/Content/img/Help_Backup_SelectVolunteerTable.png" />

<!-- Version 1: Walkthroughs
<article>
    <p>Whether you're a new user wanting to get a feel for things or you're more experienced but wanting to improve your knowledge, the info on this page should be helpful to you. Here you'll find a tutorial that goes through the relevant pages for both a volunteer user and an administrator. At the end, we've included some anticipated Frequently Asked Questions. If after reading you still have unanswered questions, please see an administrator for clarification.</p>

    <h3>Volunteer Tutorial</h3>

    <h4>The Home Page</h4>

    <p>When you first pull up the website, you'll see the home page.</p>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="~/Content/img/Help1_HomePageOverview.png" />

    <p>On the left side of the screen are places where an administrator can display a message and/or an image to all users.</p>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="~/Content/img/Help_HomePageAnnouncements.png" />

    <p>If you've just walked into the clinic and you're ready to clock in for the day, you'll enter your email address in the Work Log section and click or tap Submit.</p>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="~/Content/img/Help2_ClockIn.png" />

    <p>The Recent Activity tracker will now show your name and the time you clocked in.</p>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="~/Content/img/Help3_RecentActivityClockIn.png" />

    <p>When you want to clock out, you'll go through the same process again: Enter your email, click or tap Submit.</p>

    <p>Your activity will again show up in the tracker. Now the "Out" column will have your clock-out time.</p>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="~/Content/img/Help_RecentActivityClockOut.png" />

    <p><strong>Note: Don't worry if you forgot to clock in/out. You can also enter your hours worked from your profile. We'll cover that below.</strong></p>

    <p>If you want to access your volunteer profile page, you'll need to be logged in. If you haven't logged in already, you can do so by selecting "Log In" at the top right.</p>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="~/Content/img/Help_ClickLogIn.png" />

    <h4>The Log In Page</h4>

    <img class="img-responsive" src="~/Content/img/Help_LogInOverview.png" />

    <p>Enter your email address and password. (Note: If you're not yet a registered user, please speak to an administrator so that he/she can set up a profile for you.)</p>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="~/Content/img/Help_LogInEnterCreds.png" />

    <p>If you want your web browser to remember your password for you, then check "Remember me". Then the next time that you come back to the log in screen, your browser will enter your password for you automatically. </p>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="~/Content/img/Help_LogIn_CheckRememberMe.png" />

    <p>Click or tap the "Log In" button.</p>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="~/Content/img/Help_LogIn_ClickLogInButton.png" />

    <p>If something was entered incorrectly, you'll see a red "Invalid login attempt" message.</p>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="~/Content/img/Help_LogIn_InvalidLogInAttempt.png" />

    <p>Otherwise, you are now logged in and can navigate to your volunteer profile page by clicking "Hello [your name here]!" at the top right of the screen (where "Register" was before you logged in).</p>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="~/Content/img/Help_LogIn_NowLoggedIn.png" />

    <h4>Your Profile Page</h4>

    <p>From the home page, if you click or tap on "Hello [your name here]!" (assuming that you're logged in), you'll be taken to your profile.</p>

    <img class="img-responsive" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_Overview.png" />

    <p>Here you can see your personal information. This info is viewable by all administrators, but not by other volunteers. Administrators use this info to keep track of things like your availability, your specialty(ies), and whether you're still an active volunteer. If you want to change something, click or tap Edit.</p>
    <img class="img-responsive" src="~/Content/img/Help_Profile_ClickEdit.png" />

    <p>Now you can edit your profile. Note that if you enter something in the wrong format (e.g. phone number without an area code, email address without an "at" symbol), the page will display red error text beneath the relevant field(s).</p>


    <p>When you're done, click or tap Save Changes.</p>

    <p>You can also go back to the home screen from your profile by selecting Clock-In/Clock-Out</p>

    <h4>The Contact Page</h4>

    <p>You can go here to see contact info for the clinic, including an interactive map.</p>

    <h3>Administrator Tutorial</h3>

    <p>When you first pull up the website, you'll see the home page.</p>
    <!--<img class="img-" src="~/Content/img/Help1_HomePageOverview.png" />

    <p>On the upper left side of the screen are places where you can display a message and/or an image to all users. We'll get to how you can do that in a bit.</p>

    <!-- <p>Below these, there are links to frequently used options, such as the Report View.</p>*

    <h4>The Dashboard Page</h4>

    <p>Here you'll see a table of volunteers, with information about them including last name, first name, specialty (e.g. Nurse, Physican), email address, phone number, the date he/she started volunteering, and a checkbox indicating whether he/she is still an active volunteer.</p>

    <p>Next to each volunteer you'll see a Details button and an Edit button.</p>

    <p>If you click Details, you'll see the profile page for that volunteer. </p>

    <p>You can filter the volunteers shown in the table in several different ways to see only the ones that you need to see right now.</p>

    <p></p>

    <h3>FAQ</h3>

    <h4>How do I clock in?</h4>
    <p>Navigate to the home page. Enter your email in the "Work Log" box and click or tap Submit. You are now clocked in!</p>

    <h4>Something's wrong with my profile information. How do I change it?</h4>
    <p>Go to your profile page by clicking "Hello [your name here]!" at the top right of the screen. On your page, click or tap "Edit". Now you can start changing what's in the fields. When you're done, click or tap Save Changes.</p>

    <h4>Will Rick Astley ever give someone up?</h4>
    <p>We're not sure why people keep asking this question. No, that's absolutely absurd.</p>
